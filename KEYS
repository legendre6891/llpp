double/triple/quadruple/... clicks in view mode will pipe the
word/line/block/page through pax command when control is held
and selection command otherwise

[1] if the document was previously visited initial backspace will
    jump to the last visited place

[2] i'm somewhat mouse button confused, since i use "left handed" mouse
    while not being left handed

[3] text selection requires
    X11     - xsel http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/
    â‹¯       - xclip https://github.com/astrand/xclip
    Windows - wsel http://repo.or.cz/w/llpp.git/blob/master:/wsel.c
    OS X    - pbcopy ships with the system

[4] arguments to the command are:
    1 = path to the document
    2 = zero based page number
    3 = X coordinate within the page
    4 = Y ..........................

[5] document will also be reloaded upon reception of the HUP signal

-----Caveat emptor-----
o Selection can not cross page boundaries
o Text searching is very naive
